# STA9890_project
Machine Learning - Regression Project

The primary purpose of this project was to investigate the differences in cross validations times and MSE between elastic-net, lasso, and ridge penalized regression as compared to random forest in order to determine which of the models performed best given the data used. 

The data used were input responses from aircraft controls which were used to assess the relationship between the data and the position of the plane's ailerons.
